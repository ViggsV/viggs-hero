# Viggs' Portfolio Website

---

## Features

- Interactive and responsive portfolio site built with React and Tailwind CSS
- Audio feedback using Howler.js
- Hobbies and interests section

---

## Tech Stack

- **React** – Component-based structure and state management
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **Howler.js** – JavaScript audio library for adding ambient or interactive sounds

---

## How it Works

The site is built as a single-page application using React components. Each section (About, Projects, Hobbies, Contact) is a component styled using Tailwind utility classes. Audio effects are triggered on interactions via Howler.js.

The goal is to create a smooth, immersive experience that reflects my style and personality while clearly presenting my work and interests.

## Developer Notes

This project is both a portfolio and a playground — a place to test design, experiment with interactivity, and share who I am through code. It will keep evolving as I grow as a developer.

Feel free to fork, remix, or reach out if you’d like to collaborate or provide feedback.
